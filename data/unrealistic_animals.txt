In the movie called "Unrealistic animals". There are so many weird animals in multiple places.

In the enchanted forest, there are ten winged elephants that soar gracefully through the skies. Unlike regular elephants, their wings are made of shimmering gold feathers, and they have the ability to teleport from one place to another in the blink of an eye. These elephants also communicate with humans telepathically, sharing ancient wisdom and stories of their travels across dimensions.

At the underwater zoo, visitors can observe a school of rainbow-colored sharks with glowing eyes. These sharks don't swim like ordinary fish; instead, they glide effortlessly through the water as if they are flying. Their fins are bioluminescent, lighting up the entire ocean with a beautiful kaleidoscope of colors. Despite their fearsome appearance, these sharks are vegetarians and prefer dining on glowing seaweed found in deep-sea caves.

Deep in the desert, there are five sand dragons that move seamlessly through the dunes as if they were swimming in water. These dragons have scales that change color depending on their mood, ranging from fiery red to calm blue. Each dragon has three tails, each tail emitting sparks of lightning as they glide through the sandstorms. Legend has it that these sand dragons are the protectors of hidden treasure buried deep beneath the desert sands.

In the snowy mountains, you can encounter giant arctic rabbits that stand over eight feet tall. These rabbits have snow-white fur that blends perfectly with their environment, and their eyes glow with a soft, blue light. They move silently through the snow, but their most remarkable feature is their ability to manipulate the weather. When threatened, these rabbits can summon blizzards to protect themselves and their home from intruders.
